1.  In general, why would you even want to join two (or more) tables together? This is a good time to think about the nature of relational algebra.

   - To connect two tables together to get a query that fulfills your requirement

2. Describe in your own words the output from an inner join.

   - An inner join applies two logical query processing phases

3.  Describe in your own words the output from an outer join.

   - have only one standard syntax—the one in which the JOIN keyword is specified between the table names and
     the join condition is specified in the ON clause.

4. Describe in your own words the output from an cross join.

   - Its the simplest form of join for multiple tables.

5. A convenient mnemonic for remembering the various joins is “Ohio.” Why is this true?

   - On clause is the o then it would be inner join and outer join.

6. Give an example of a composite join.

   - It is the primary key

7. What is the difference between the following two queries? The business problem is “How many orders do we have from each customer?”

   - the first query is counting all of the numorders while the second query is only counting the ordersid from orders table.

8. What might be one reason the following query does not return the column custID in this query?

   - The query should not say "Sales."
